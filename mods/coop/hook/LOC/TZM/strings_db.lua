A02_T01_050_010="[{i Leopard11}]: My AI is always calculating your next move."
A02_T01_060_010="[{i Leopard11}]: The civilians here are under my protection."
A02_T01_070_010="[{i Leopard11}]: This is not a fight you can win."
A02_T01_080_010="[{i Leopard11}]: I will parade your remains through the streets."
A03_B01_000_010="Date: 23-AUGUST-3844"
A03_B01_001_010="You have performed well thus far, Knight, but your trials are far from over. Ten days ago we launched an offensive against UEF forces positioned on Matar."
A03_B01_002_010="Despite my planning, seizing the planet has proven much more difficult than expected. This is unacceptable. You will go to Matar and relieve Crusader Eris. She has been in constant battle and is in need of rest. "
A03_B01_003_010="I assume that the Princess has no objection with this strategy, Toth?"
A03_B01_003_020="No. She objects to the wholesale slaughter of innocent civilians."
A03_B01_003_030="No one is innocent in this war, Toth. Everyone has blood on their hands. You have your orders, Knight. Carry them out."
A03_D01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Choir to Knight, respond. Choir to Knight, please respond.  We've lost your signal, please respond."
A03_M01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Crusader Eris, the Avatar-of-War thanks you for your efforts on behalf of the Illuminate. You are relieved and may return to base."
A03_M01_010_020="[{i Eris}]: Knight, the UEF army is massing for another attack. You need to prepare your defenses. Eris out."
A03_M01_010_030="[{i Choir}]: Move quickly to repair and rebuild, Commander. Strengthen your defensive line! Choir out."
A03_M01_020_010="[{i Choir}]: Sensors indicate that the UEF forces are prepping for a major assault on your position. You only have a few minutes. Choir out."
A03_M01_030_010="[{i Choir}]: An attack force of light air units is inbound. Choir out."
A03_M01_040_010="[{i Choir}]: You are running out of time. The UEF attack is imminent. Choir out."
A03_M01_060_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF will be upon you shortly. Choir out."
A03_M01_070_010="[{i Toth}]: The UEF is coming."
A03_M01_070_020="[{i Arnold}]: Now you will pay for your crimes against humanity!"
A03_M01_080_010="[{i Choir}]: You have defeated the first wave. Our intel states that the UEF Commander will use ground units the next time he attacks. Choir Out. "
A03_M01_090_010="[{i Arnold}]: The Aeon's days are numbered. The UEF will emerge victorious."
A03_M01_100_010="[{i Choir}]: The second wave has been repelled. Sensors indicate the UEF Commander is constructing a substantial naval force. Be prepared for an attack from the sea. Choir out."
A03_M01_110_010="[{i Arnold}]: Time to take off the gloves."
A03_M01_120_010="[{i Choir}]: You have held off the UEF assault. The Avatar will be pleased to hear of your success. Choir out."
A03_M01_120_020="[{i Arnold}]: I'll be damned. Maybe you ain't a pansy after all."
A03_M01_OBJ_010_111="Survive UEF Assault"
A03_M01_OBJ_010_112="Repair and rebuild your defenses. Do not let the UEF overrun your position. Expect attacks from all directions: air, land, and sea."

A03_M01_OBJ_020_122="You built over %s Gunships."
A03_M02_010_010="[{i Choir}]: It is now time to strike back. Your main target is the UEF Commander. There are three UEF bases on the islands surrounding your position. The enemy Commander is at one of those bases. Find and eliminate him. Choir out."
A03_M02_020_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF Commander is utilizing a personal Quantum Teleportation Upgrade. We are scanning to determine his location. Choir out."
A03_M02_030_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF Commander has teleported to the northern island. Choir out."
A03_M02_040_010="[{i Choir}]: We found him. He has teleported to the southern island. Press the attack. Choir out."
A03_M02_050_010="[{i Choir}]: We have traced him to the southeastern island. Move into attack position. Choir out."
A03_M02_060_010="[{i Choir}]: The land base is no longer a threat, Knight. Choir out."
A03_M02_070_010="[{i Choir}]: The air base has been destroyed. Choir out"
A03_M02_080_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF naval base is in ruins. Choir out."
A03_M02_090_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF Commander has fled the area! Pursue and destroy him! Choir out."
A03_M02_100_010="[{i Choir}]: Knight, the Avatar expects the UEF Commander to fall by your hand ASAP. Choir out."
A03_M02_105_010="[{i Choir}]: We are fully confident that you can defeat the UEF Commander. Choir out."
A03_M02_OBJ_010_211="Defeat the UEF Commander"
A03_M02_OBJ_010_212="This Commander has proven most capable. Defeat him and claim Matar for the Illuminate."

A03_M02_OBJ_020_212="Be Advised: The UEF Commander has significant land forces on the island. Keep that in mind as you plan your attack."
A03_M02_OBJ_020_221="Destroy UEF Air Base"
A03_M02_OBJ_020_222="This island has several Air Factories. Anti-air is recommended for the assault."
A03_M02_OBJ_020_231="Destroy UEF Naval Base"
A03_M02_OBJ_020_232="This base houses the majority of the UEF Commander's Naval Factories. Expect naval resistance."
A03_M03_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Knight, the UEF Commander has fled to his main base. Pursue and destroy him. Choir out."
A03_M03_020_010="[{i Toth}]: Harmony to you, Knight. I apologize for this interruption, but the Princess wishes to speak to you. It is a matter of great importance."
A03_M03_020_020="[{i Princess}]: Hello, Knight. We have not yet had the pleasure of a proper introduction, but I have something important to tell you. The UEF Commander that you face is named Zachary Arnold. He holds the key to our future. When he faces defeat, he will surrender to you. Once he lays down his arms, you will bring him to me. I am placing my trust in you, Knight."
A03_M03_030_010="[{i Choir}]: We have detected a large naval force gathering at the UEF base. They are moving into attack position--prepare for a naval assault. Choir out."
A03_M03_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: You will never conquer Matar."
A03_M03_050_010="[{i Choir}]: The naval force has been defeated. Continue your assault against Commander Arnold."
A03_M03_060_010="[{i Marxon}]: I have been informed that the Princess has contacted you, Knight. You are to ignore her. I am your commanding officer, and there will be serious repercussions if you disobey me. Is that clear?"
A03_M03_070_010="[{i Princess}]: Do not concern yourself with Avatar Marxon. I have foreseen your future. You are safe. Continue with your mission, Commander."
A03_M03_080_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF Commander cannot flee from you much longer, Knight. Your victory will be swift. Choir out. "
A03_M03_085_010="[{i Choir}]: This UEF Commander is skilled, but we have faith you will defeat him, Knight. Choir out."
A03_M03_090_010="[{i Arnold}]: Ah, blast it. You fried my logic array...I thought that was impossible. I can't move...trapped...never take me alive..."
A03_M03_090_020="[{i Princess}]: You need not die, Commander Arnold. Your fate lies elsewhere. Listen to my words. You know I speak the truth."
A03_M03_090_030="[{i Arnold}]: Yes...now I understand..."
A03_M03_090_040="[{i Princess}]: It is as I have seen. Secure Commander Arnold, Knight. I eagerly await your arrival."
A03_M03_OBJ_010_311="Defeat the UEF Commander"
A03_M03_OBJ_010_312="The UEF cannot resist for much longer. Defeat the enemy Commander and deliver Matar to the Illuminate."
A03_T01_010_010="[{i Arnold}]: You will never conquer Matar."
A03_T01_020_010="[{i Arnold}]: The UEF will never surrender to the Aeon."
A03_T01_030_010="[{i Arnold}]: You are a fanatic."
A03_T01_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: The end game is approaching. You will lose."
A03_T01_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: The UEF will save the galaxy from you fanatics."
A03_T01_060_010="[{i Arnold}]: I will restore order to the galaxy."
A03_T01_070_010="[{i Arnold}]: You're not winning this fight."
A03_T01_080_010="[{i Arnold}]: I'm gonna add your head to my trophy case."
A04_B01_000_010="Date: 29-AUGUST-3844"
A04_B01_001_010="Harmony to you, Knight. You performed well on Matar, but the situation has become complicated. Commander Arnold was personally enlightened by the Princess, but he revealed some troubling news. "
A04_B01_002_010="The UEF is constructing a weapon of horrific power called Black Sun. It can destroy entire planets. Avatar Marxon is already lobbying for an all-out attack on Earth."
A04_B01_003_010="Hello, Knight. I wish we could meet under better circumstances. The Avatar's war drums are getting louder, and it will be difficult to hold him in check."
A04_B01_003_020="That is why the Princess has removed you from the service of Avatar Marxon. From this day forward, you will serve the Princess directly. You will be her Champion."
A04_B01_004_010="This is Procyon, a planet deep in Cybran territory. We know little of it save its name."
A04_B01_004_020="In my meditations, I have sensed something there, some...other. I cannot describe it, but it troubles me greatly. You must go to Procyon and discover what it is."
A04_B01_005_010="Fear not, Champion. I sense greatness in you. "
A04_B01_005_020="You gate to Procyon immediately. Go forth with grace, Champion of the Illuminate."
A04_D01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Choir to Champion, respond. Choir to Champion, please respond. We've lost your signal, please respond."
A04_M01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, there is a Cybran settlement called Nexus04 to your north. The Princess does not want the population cleansed, but you are to eliminate all military resistance within the settlement. Choir out."
A04_M01_020_010="[{i Elliott}]: Attention all Cybran Commanders. This is Director Elliott at Node73. An Aeon Commander has just landed southeast of Nexus04. We need assistance! The Aeon will murder us all!"
A04_M01_020_020="[{i Choir}]: Champion, there is a facility called Node73 to your northwest. It appears to house a data-relay station of unknown purpose. Proceed to the facility and capture the 'Node'. Choir out."
A04_M01_030_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, we detect a Cybran naval base on the lake to the west. Naval units are forming a blockade on the river in order to cut off access to it. You are not required to destroy the naval base; attack at your discretion. Choir out."
A04_M01_040_010="[{i Choir}]: The Cybran naval base has been eliminated. The lake is now secure. Choir out."
A04_M01_050_010="[{i Choir}]: We are detecting incoming Cybran units. Prepare for battle. Choir out."
A04_M01_060_010="[{i Gauge}]: This will be your final day."
A04_M01_070_010="[{i Choir}]: The Cybran presence here is stronger than we anticipated. We are uploading the 'Shield of Light' Tech 2 Shield Generator schematic into your ACU. The shield generator was designed to protect you from general ordinance, such as artillery and bombs. Choir out."
A04_M01_080_010="[{i Gauge}]: Your days of hunting Symbionts are coming to an end."
A04_M01_090_010="[{i Gauge}]: Don't think I'm going to let you have that, fanatic."
A04_M01_100_010="[{i Choir}]: The Node is heavily defended by artillery, so we are giving you the 'Asylum' Tech 2 Mobile Shield Generator schematic. Construct a few of them; they should let your units get close to the enemy without taking too much damage. Choir out."
A04_M01_110_010="[{i Choir}]: Nexus04 is no longer a threat. Advance and capture the Node. Choir out."
A04_M01_120_010="[{i Elliott}]: This is Director Elliott. The Aeon are assaulting Node73...someone do something! The Aeon are right on top of us!"
A04_M01_120_020="[{i Gauge}]: Keep your pants on. I've got units inbound to your position."
A04_M01_130_010="[{i Choir}]: Remember, Champion, you need only defeat the war machines in the settlement. Choir out. "
A04_M01_135_010="[{i Choir}]: The Princess is worried that pacifying Nexus04 is taking too long, Champion. Is there a problem? Choir out."
A04_M01_140_010="[{i Choir}]: The Princess has ordered that the Node be captured ASAP, Champion. Choir out. "
A04_M01_145_010="[{i Choir}]: The success of the mission hinges on capturing the Node in a timely fashion, Champion. Choir out."
A04_M01_150_010="[{i Choir}]: The Node has been captured. The techs are preparing to connect to it via a Quantum uplink. Choir out."
A04_M01_OBJ_010_010="Pacify Nexus04"
A04_M01_OBJ_010_011="Destroy all war machines present in the settlement. It is not necessary to destroy the settlement itself."
A04_M01_OBJ_010_020="Capture the Node"
A04_M01_OBJ_010_021="There is a Facility to the northwest built around a Node. Its purpose is unknown, so capture the Node and uncover the Cybrans' plans."
A04_M01_OBJ_020_010="Destroy the Cybran Naval Base"
A04_M01_OBJ_020_015="Do not let the enemy establish a base in your sector. Send your forces across the lake and destroy the enemy base."
A04_M01_OBJ_020_050="Flying Fortress"
A04_M01_OBJ_020_055="You built over %s Strategic Bombers."
A04_M01_OBJ_020_060="Guard Duty"
A04_M01_OBJ_020_065="All three Nodes survive."
A04_M02_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Our technicians have been unable to penetrate deeper into the Node network. The Nodes simply provide processing power for a larger Mainframe to the north. The Mainframe is heavily defended, but our technicians have been able to isolate and neutralize all nearby defensive structures. Capture the Mainframe so our technicians can continue their work. Once the Mainframe has been captured, the surrounding defenses will come under your control. Choir out."
A04_M02_020_010="[{i Choir}]: We have hacked into the Mainframe and are investigating. Protect the Mainframe at all costs. Choir out."
A04_M02_030_010="[{i Choir}]: Node 72 has been captured. Begin constructing defenses around it. Choir out."
A04_M02_040_010="[{i Choir}]: Node 74 has been captured. Reinforce the position as you see fit. Choir out."
A04_M02_050_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, the Cybrans are attempting to cut the Mainframe off from the Network! You must protect the Nodes in our sector until we have extracted the data that we need. Capture the Nodes and then defend them from Cybran attack. Choir out."
A04_M02_050_020="[{i Gauge}]: Not today, Aeon!"
A04_M02_060_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, our technicians unlocked some of the Node's functions and have located an algorithm. Each Node you control increases resource production. Capture all three for the maximum benefit. Choir out."
A04_M02_070_010="[{i Choir}]: Cybran attacks are incoming! They appear to be focused on the Mainframe, but don't forget about defending the Nodes. Choir out."
A04_M02_080_010="[{i Choir}]: The technicians are still working, Champion. Continue to defend the Nodes! Choir out."
A04_M02_090_010="[{i Choir}]: The technicians are getting close, but they need more time! Choir out."
A04_M02_100_010="[{i Choir}]: They're almost done. The technicians just need a little more time! Choir out."
A04_M02_110_010="[{i Choir}]: A Node has been destroyed, but we're still using the other two Nodes. Protect them! Choir out."
A04_M02_120_010="[{i Choir}]: A second Node has been lost. We cannot lose any more! Our mission will end in failure if we lose the last Node! Choir out."
A04_M02_130_010="[{i Choir}]: The Mainframe is key to the Princess' plan. Capture it ASAP, Champion. Choir out. "
A04_M02_135_010="[{i Choir}]: The technicians are ready to begin investigating the Mainframe, but you need to capture it first, Champion. Choir out."
A04_M02_140_010="[{i Choir}]: The Nodes must be captured so the technicians can continue their work, Champion. Choir out. "
A04_M02_145_010="[{i Choir}]: We must have full access to the Cybran network if we are to uncover their secrets, Champion. Capture those Nodes ASAP. Choir out."
A04_M02_150_010="[{i Choir}]: We've lost all the Nodes. The mission cannot be completed. Abort and return home, Champion. Choir out."
A04_M02_160_010="[{i Princess}]: The veil has been lifted and now I...understand. Return home, Champion. There is much to discuss."
A04_M02_OBJ_010_010="Capture and Defend the Mainframe"
A04_M02_OBJ_010_015="The Mainframe should have the information the Princess requires. You must capture and defend the Mainframe while technicians work on deciphering its contents."
A04_M02_OBJ_010_020="Capture and Defend All Three Nodes."
A04_M02_OBJ_010_025="The Nodes are critical to the operation, the technicians will use them to access the Mainframe and search its databanks. Capture the remaining Nodes and then defend all of them. If all the Nodes are lost, the technicians will be unable to access the Mainframe and the operation will fail. Expect the Cybrans to attack with air, land, and naval units."
A04_T01_010_010="[{i Gauge}]: Procyon will be your tomb."
A04_T01_020_010="[{i Gauge}]: We will never bow down to your madness."
A04_T01_030_010="[{i Gauge}]: Your fanaticism is destroying the galaxy."
A04_T01_040_010="[{i Gauge}]: Today you die."
A04_T01_050_010="[{i Gauge}]: Grrrrrr."
A04_T01_060_010="[{i Gauge}]: The Way is nothing more than a fairy tale."
A04_T01_070_010="[{i Gauge}]: There is nothing here for you except death."
A04_T01_080_010="[{i Gauge}]: We will be free!"
A05_B01_000_010="DATE: 09-SEPTEMBER-3844"
A05_B01_001_010="You performed well on Procyon, Champion, but there are more ill tidings. The Cybrans are preparing to deploy a Quantum Virus via Black Sun. The Virus will destroy the Gate Network. "
A05_B01_002_005="Marxon learned of the Cybran super weapon through one of his agents and immediately launched an all-out assault against the UEF. Avatar Marxon has lost all reason. "
A05_B01_002_007="Marxon is not enlightening. He has abandoned The Way and has ordered his Commanders to slaughter everyone, military and civilian alike. Marxon's strength lies in the Commanders that follow him, but we believe that many will abandon him if given the opportunity.  "
A05_B01_003_010="This is Eridani. It is deep in UEF territory, and Crusaders Rhiza and Ariel have launched attacks on the planet, sowing destruction on Marxon's orders. You will go to Eridani and press the Princesses' case. All who refuse you must be silenced."
A05_B01_003_020="Rhiza, despite her flaws, is a firm believer in The Way and is well respected in the military. If she abandons the Avatar, many others will follow. Ariel is an enigma. I do not know her mind."
A05_B01_004_010="One last word, my Champion. The \"otherness\" I sensed on Procyon is an AI that was created by the Cybrans. The AI uses the Quantum Gate Network as part of its consciousness. It is the reason my visions have been cloudy. News of the Cybran's plan has given me an idea: Could I also use Black Sun to move my consciousness into the Quantum Realm? I would use Black Sun's power to connect with every human in the galaxy. And end the Infinite War."
A05_B01_005_019="We now believe that our ancestors were wrong to start this conflict. The original teachings of the Seraphim have been corrupted, and The Way is now little more than a weapon. The Princess will correct this. I began the process by ensuring her placement on the throne, and now you will be her sword. Go forth and show Marxon how a true believer in The Way fights."
A05_D01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Choir to Champion, respond. Choir to Champion, please respond. We've lost your signal, please respond."
A05_M01_010_010="[{i Princess}]: Crusaders, stay your weapons. Your Princess, Rhianne Burke, commands it. The Avatar-of-War has overstepped his authority and now acts against the wishes of the Illuminate. I call upon you to refuse his orders and uphold the truth of The Way."
A05_M01_010_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Yes, my Princess. I will gladly serve your champion. "
A05_M01_010_030="[{i Princess}]: And what say you, Crusader Ariel?"
A05_M01_010_040="[{i Ariel}]: The UEF stands on the brink of defeat. That is the Avatar's doing, Princess, not yours. I stand with Marxon and will destroy any who threaten him."
A05_M01_010_050="[{i Princess}]: I am truly saddened by what must be done. Champion, the civilians are to be protected at all costs. As for Crusader Ariel, you will end her rampage."
A05_M01_010_060="[{i Choir}]: Champion, the Princess has ordered you to protect the civilians. Crusader Rhiza will act as your support-commander. She will help rebuild and repair your base. Choir out."
A05_M01_020_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Ariel was constructing a squadron of bombers. You must protect the colonies with Heavy Shield Generators. I will upload the schematic to you. "
A05_M01_020_030="[{i Choir}]: We confirm that Ariel is constructing a squadron of bombers. These markers display the optimal shield placement points. Build a Heavy Shield Generator as indicated. Choir out. "
A05_M01_030_010="[{i Blake}]: Dammit, more Aeon!"
A05_M01_030_020="[{i Princess}]: We mean you no harm, Commander Blake. We merely wish to save these colonies."
A05_M01_030_030="[{i Blake}]: Like hell. I know how you freaks \"save\" colonies. "
A05_M01_030_040="[{i Princess}]: Please, listen to my words. We need not fight one another."
A05_M01_030_050="[{i Blake}]: Don't try that mystic rubbish with me. It isn't going to work!"
A05_M01_040_010="[{i Choir}]: All shields are in place. The colonies are now protected. Choir out. "
A05_M01_050_010="[{i Ariel}]: Let us see how well the Champion fights. "
A05_M01_050_020="[{i Choir}]: Champion, Ariel's bombers are inbound. Deploy anti-air defenses and protect the civilian colonies. Choir out. "
A05_M01_060_010="[{i Choir}]: The colonies survived Ariel's attack! Choir out."
A05_M01_070_010="[{i Ariel}]: Hmmm, well enough, I suppose. But how will she fare against strategic missiles? "
A05_M01_070_020="[{i Choir}]: Sensors show that Ariel is building a Strategic Missile Launcher. We are uploading the schematic for the 'Patron' Tech 3 Strategic Missile Defense to your ACU. Construct a missile defense facility at each of the indicated points. Choir out. "
A05_M01_080_010="[{i Choir}]: We show that the Strategic Missile Defenses are complete. Ariel's missiles should do no more harm. Choir out. "
A05_M01_090_010="[{i Ariel}]: It is time to end this. "
A05_M01_090_020="[{i Choir}]: Ariel has launched a nuclear missile! Choir out."
A05_M01_100_010="[{i Ariel}]: I will have to do this the traditional way."
A05_M01_100_020="[{i Choir}]: Ariel is attacking the eastern colony with air power. Scramble fighters and anti-air units to protect it. Choir out."
A05_M01_110_010="[{i Choir}]: Crusader Ariel is trying to disembark ground units near the western colony. Prepare your defenses. Choir out. "
A05_M01_120_010="[{i Choir}]: Ariel is now attacking both colonies with combined air and land assets. Protect the colonies! Choir out."
A05_M01_130_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Princess!"
A05_M01_140_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, you still have not deployed all the Strategic Missile Defenses! You must move quickly! Choir out."
A05_M01_145_010="[{i Choir}]: The colonies are still not protected with Strategic Missile Defenses. You must build them quickly! Choir out."
A05_M01_150_010="[{i Choir}]: There have been too many civilian casualties--the other Commanders have abandoned us for Marxon. Abort and return. Choir out."

C03_B01_003_010="Time is against us. Perhaps Dr. Sweeney will be able to offer us some guidance. No doubt that the UEF misses one of its top scientists, but he's our guest now. Oh yes. Ah, Commander. A pity about Mach. He was such a good boy. So full of promise."

We have made the 'Deceiver' Mobile Stealth Field System schematic available to you. Load an Engineer and Mobile Stealth Unit onto a transport and try to reach the Nodes.

C05_M01_070_010="[{i Ops}]: The Generators are still online, sir. We need to get those down ASAP. Ops out."
C05_M01_OBJ_010_111="Destroy UEF Power Generators"
C05_M01_OBJ_010_112="The prison shields must be disabled so Hex5 can rescue his Node-mates. Destroy the Power Generators located south of your starting position. Doing so will lower the shields."
C05_M01_OBJ_020_121="Destroy Frigate Groups"
C05_M01_OBJ_020_122="Clear the water by destroying all the Frigates and their accompanying subs.\nThis will expose the western flank of the UEF's position."
C05_M02_010_010="[{i Hex5}]: My friends are free, but you need to do one more thing for me. The UEF Omni-Sensors interfere with my stealth field. You need to destroy those sensors before I'll give you the codes. I'm not going to let them find me."
C05_M02_010_020="[{i Ops}]: This keeps getting better and better. There are three Omni-Sensors in the area: to the south; the southwest; and northwest. Destroy them. We need those codes! Ops out."
C05_M02_020_010="[{i Godwyn}]: What are you really after?"
C05_M02_030_010="[{i Godwyn}]: Even if you destroy my sensors, I will still find you. There is no place for you to run."
C05_M02_040_010="[{i Ops}]: Because of the UEF's reliance on Gunships, you should counter with Air Superiority Fighters. The schematic for the 'Gemini' Tech 3 Air Superiority Fighter has uploaded. Ops out."
C05_M02_050_010="[{i Ops}]: The UEF's naval base has been destroyed. Nice job. Ops out."
C05_M02_060_010="[{i Ops}]: That's one Omni-Sensor down. Ops out."
C05_M02_070_010="[{i Ops}]: Two Omnis are down, Commander. Ops out."
C05_M02_080_010="[{i Ops}]: The Omni-Sensors are down. Hex5 should be contacting you soon. Ops out."
C05_M02_080_020="[{i Hex5}]: Here are my coordinates. Meet me there personally. I'm not about to hand this intel over to an Engineer. Hex5 out."
C05_M02_080_030="[{i Ops}]: Move your ACU to Hex5's position and get the codes, Commander. We only get one shot at this! Ops out."
C05_M02_090_010="[{i Hex5}]: Uploading the codes now. Upload is complete. Don't try and follow me."
C05_M02_090_020="[{i Ops}]: Detecting UEF Gunships, Commander! They're vectoring in from the southeast and heading directly toward your base."
C05_M02_090_030="[{i Hex5}]: Blast it...the UEF is closing in on me..."
C05_M02_090_040="[{i Godwyn}]: You won't elude me forever."
C05_M02_100_010="[{i Ops}]: Hex5 is waiting for the Omnis to go offline, sir. Ops out. "
C05_M02_105_010="[{i Ops}]: The sooner those Omnis are destroyed, the sooner you can get off that planet. Ops out."
C05_M02_110_010="[{i Ops}]: Hex5 is waiting to deliver the codes, sir. Ops out. "
C05_M02_115_010="[{i Ops}]: Dr. Brackman is eager to get those codes, sir. Go meet Hex5 ASAP. Ops out. "
C05_M02_120_010="[{i Ops}]: The Gunships have been routed and the codes are secure. Let's get you off that rock. Ops out."
C05_M02_OBJ_010_211="Destroy Omni-Sensors"
C05_M02_OBJ_010_212="Hex5 will only give you Black Sun's access codes if he feels the area is secure. Destroy all three Omni-Sensors and get the codes from Hex5. Each Omni is in a defended camp and they are located to the south, southwest, and northwest."
C05_M02_OBJ_010_221="Reach Hex5 with Your Commander"
C05_M02_OBJ_010_222="Hex5 will only deliver the codes to you in person. Move your ACU to Hex5's position and get the codes."

C05_M03_010_020="[{i Dostya}]: Leave him to rot. Him and his kind only look out for themselves."
C05_M03_010_030="[{i Brackman}]: We do not abandon any Cybran, no matter who they may be. There is also the risk of the UEF uncovering our plans and changing the codes. Oh yes. You will defeat the UEF Commander and free Hex5."
C05_M03_020_010="[{i Godwyn}]: I have your friend, Cybran. Soon he will reveal all of your plans."
C05_M03_020_020="[{i Hex5}]: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"
C05_M03_030_010="[{i QAI}]: Commander, I have uploaded a prototype virus into your ACU. It will cause all UEF Gunships to self-destruct. Move an Engineer due south of your base and capture the enemy's Air Staging Platform. If you are successful, all UEF Gunships will automatically self-destruct and the UEF will not be able to construct replacements. This is not an order, it is simply an option. QAI out."
C05_M03_050_010="[{i Ops}]: You did it, sir! The Gunships are self-destructing!"
C05_M03_050_020="[{i Godwyn}]: This is Major Harold Godwyn to all UEF Commanders in the Sector. I am under attack by Cybran forces and request assistance. I repeat: I am under attack by Cybran forces and request assistance."
C05_M03_050_030="[{i Brackman}]: Take him out, my boy. Those access codes must not be changed!"
C05_M03_060_010="[{i Ops}]: That's the prison complex, sir. Don't worry about it, Hex5 is being held in the main UEF base. Ops out."
C05_M03_070_010="[{i Godwyn}]: I don't know what you did to my Gunships, Chip-head, but it won't matter. Soon reinforcements will arrive and this matter will be settled once and for all."
C05_M03_080_010="[{i Ops}]: Hex5 has been killed, sir. At least we still got the codes. Come on home, Ops out."
C05_M03_090_010="[{i Godwyn}]: This is Major Harold Godwyn to all UEF Commanders. I need assistance, I repeat: I need..."
C05_M03_090_020="[{i Ops}]: You're done here, Commander. Return to base with those codes. We'll extract Hex5. Ops out."
C05_M03_100_010="[{i Ops}]: We can't let the UEF know of our plans! Destroy that Commander ASAP! Ops out. "
C05_M03_105_010="[{i Ops}]: The longer that UEF Commander is around, the more likely he is to figure out why Hex5 was here. Kill the Commander. Ops out."

C06_B01_001_010="It is almost done. I have lived for over a thousand years...a long time. I have watched the war...seen so many die. It must end. We must be free. It's up to you, my boy."
C06_B01_002_010="All of our sleeper cells on Earth have activated and are assaulting strategic UEF installations. This has allowed Jericho and his team to construct a base for you near Black Sun. They will assist in any way possible."
C06_B01_003_010="Your mission is to seize control of Black Sun and upload QAI's data-core directly into its Control Center. Firing the weapon will then release both the Quantum Virus and the Liberation Matrix."
C06_B01_003_020="The Gates will shut down. Everyone, everywhere, will be free. There will be peace."
C06_B01_004_010="You understand, Commander, this is a one-way trip. If you are successful, it will be at least five years before we can re-establish contact."
C06_B01_004_020="He understands, oh yes. Earth will be yours, son. The Symbionts will follow you. A new beginning, a new life. Guide Earth. Make it great."
C06_B01_004_030="It is time. Do svidanya, Commander. It has been an honor."
C06_B01_004_040="Be safe."
C06_D01_010_010="[{i Ops}]: Commander? What's your status? Commander?"
C06_M01_010_010="[{i Jericho}]: Good to see you again, Commander. We've set up what we could. It looks like the Aeon are giving the UEF a beating a couple clicks to the west."
C06_M01_010_020="[{i Ops}]: Sir, it looks like the Aeon are building some sort of...flying saucer. We don't know what it's capable of, but it's a safe bet it'll attack Black Sun. Destroy it before it can take off. It cannot be allowed to reach Black Sun! Ops out."
C06_M01_020_010="[{i Jericho}]: Commander, we've tapped into the UEF communication system. Black Sun hasn't been completed, but it's close. I'll keep you updated on its progress."
C06_M01_022_010="[{i Ops}]: We have managed to tap into the UEF's communication system. Black Sun isn't finished, but it's close. We will update as the situation warrants."
C06_M01_030_010="[{i Arnold}]: So the Cybrans have decided to enter the fray. It matters not. Soon your kind will be destroyed."

C06_M01_050_010="[{i Ops}]: The Aeon saucer is taking off and vectoring toward the Black Sun Control Center. Destroy it!"

C06_M01_070_010="[{i Ops}]: Sir, you have to take out the saucer! Ops out. "
C06_M01_075_010="[{i Ops}]: Everything is riding on Black Sun, sir! We can't let the Aeon saucer destroy it! Ops out."
C06_M01_076_010="[{i Ops}]: I would suggest you check your objectives, Commander. Ops out."
C06_M01_080_010="[{i Jericho}]: They hit with everything... "
C06_M01_090_010="[{i Dostya}]: The Saucer has destroyed the Control Center. Return to the Nation. We must prepare for the Aeon attack."
C06_M01_100_010="[{i Ops}]: YES! The Aeon saucer is down!"

C06_M02_010_020="[{i Ops}]: Commander, because of the bandwidth demands, you need to build a Quantum Gate before we can upload the QAI into your ACU. The upload will take some time, so make sure the area around the Gate is secure. Ops out."
C06_M02_020_010="[{i Jericho}]: Commander, Black Sun is almost finished! They have to charge it before it can fire, but we're running out of time!"
C06_M02_025_010="[{i Ops}]: Black Sun is nearly complete! They have to charge it before it can fire, but time is against us!"
C06_M02_030_010="[{i Ops}]: Sensors are indicating that UEF forces are moving north and establishing a defensive line. You must break through their position in order to reach the Control Center. Ops out."
C06_M02_040_010="[{i Ops}]: The Quantum Gate was destroyed! You have to build another one before we can upload QAI! Ops out."
C06_M02_050_010="[{i Ops}]: Okay, Commander, move your ACU next to the Gate. The upload will begin automatically. Do not move away from the Gate until you are notified that the upload is complete. Ops out."
C06_M02_060_010="[{i Ops}]: The upload has started, Commander. The Gate must survive, otherwise the upload will have to start again. Defend your position! Ops out."
C06_M02_070_010="[{i Ops}]: Sir, the upload was interrupted! Move your ACU back to the Gate to restart it. Ops out."
C06_M02_080_010="[{i Aiko}]: This is Captain Aiko. Black Sun is under heavy attack by Cybran and Aeon forces. Requesting assistance. I repeat, Black Sun is under attack. We need all the help we can get! Aiko out."
C06_M02_090_010="[{i QAI}]: I have been successfully uploaded into the memory of your ACU, Commander. Your next task is to deliver me to the Black Sun Control Center so that I may integrate with its systems. QAI out."

C06_M02_110_010="[{i Ops}]: Aeon forces are vectoring towards your base! Get ready! Ops out."
C06_M02_130_010="[{i QAI}]: My integration into the Black Sun Control Center is complete. I will now attempt to take control of Black Sun itself. QAI out."
C06_M02_130_020="[{i Ops}]: You did it! Once QAI finishes its integration, you can fire Black Sun. Ops out."
C06_M02_150_010="[{i Ops}]: We need that Gate built so we can upload the QAI, sir. Ops out. "
C06_M02_155_010="[{i Ops}]: Where's the Gate? We're running out of time. Ops out."
C06_M02_160_010="[{i Ops}]: Move your ACU next to the Gate to start the download, Commander. Ops out. "

C06_M02_OBJ_010_222="Move your ACU next to your Quantum Gate to initiate the download of the Quantum Virus. The ACU must remain near the Gate for a short period of time for the download to finish."

C06_M03_070_010="[{i Ops}]: All that stands between us and victory is you capturing Black Sun, sir. Ops out. "

CAMPDEB_0000="From: Crusader Rhiza\nTo: Avatar-of-War Marxon\nCc: Knight {g PlayerName}\nOperation Joust is a success. I defeated the UEF Commander mere hours ago and have finished securing the planet. The Evaluators have already begun arriving and will begin work shortly. Knight {g PlayerName}'s performance was satisfactory. With more experience, she may become a valuable Commander."
CAMPDEB_0001="To: Avatar-of-War Marxon\nCc: Knight {g PlayerName}\nFrom: Crusader Rhiza\nHonor to you, Avatar. The new Knight you sent me has proven insufficient for her task. She was unable to breach the UEF defenses nor stop their assaults. I had thought her strong in The Way, but it seems I was mistaken. I was able to continue the mission and secure Rigel. I look forward to my next assignment."
CAMPDEB_0002="From: Avatar-of-War Marxon\nTo: Knight {g PlayerName}\n I am impressed, Knight. You not only completed your mission, but managed to do it in only half the time estimated. I think you will go far in the military, assuming you know whom to listen to. I worry that you might think to follow the words of Toth. Her kind does not understand war as we do. Sentimentality has no place on the battlefield. All you need do is follow The Way as outlined by our ancestors. That is all the guidance anyone requires."
CAMPDEB_0003="From: Evaluator Toth\nTo: Her Highness, Princess Rhianne\nPrincess, I bear grave news. The one I was to watch, the one you had such hopes for, has failed. She was unable to complete her mission on Zeta Canis. It is a great blow, I know. I had begun to think she was the one. Marxon continues his ways. He has even approached some of the other Avatars, seeking to increase his power. I fear he will soon have too much support and become unstoppable. I will do what I can."
CAMPDEB_0004="From: Princess Burke\nTo: Evaluator Toth\nCc: Knight {g PlayerName}\n I have succeeded. The UEF Colonel, Zachary Arnold, has accepted The Way. He resisted far longer than I expected, but he eventually realized the Truth. His conversion, as pleasing as it is, has made our lives more difficult. He spoke to me of the UEF and its plans, of a terrible weapon being constructed. This news will only serve to bring more Commanders to Marxon's side and strengthen his power. How are we to find peace when it seems all anyone else wants is war and destruction?"
CAMPDEB_0005="From: Princess Burke\nTo: Knight {g PlayerName}\nKnight, I would like to thank you for your efforts on Matar. I realize I put you in a difficult position and that you did your best to secure the UEF Commander. I know there was something I was to learn from him, but hopefully, there will be another opportunity in the future."
CAMPDEB_0006="From: Evaluator Toth\nTo: Champion {g PlayerName}\nYou have done the Princess a great service, Champion. It seems that everyday, more and more people flock to Marxon's banner. The Princess is hard pressed and I fear not only for her, but for all of our people. She will need your strength in the days to come. I will do what I can, but I feel that I will not see the end of this struggle. Keep Rhianne safe, Champion, the future must belong to her."
CAMPDEB_0007="From: Evaluator Toth\nTo: Her Highness, Princess Rhianne\nPrincess, the failure of your Champion on Procyon has left you in a perilous state. Marxon has used this to further erode your position. He argues that if your chosen Champion is weak, then by extension, you are as well. Others are listening, and more move to stand behind Marxon every day. If we are to stop him, then something must be done soon!"
CAMPDEB_0008="From: Princess Burke\nTo: Champion {g PlayerName}\nWith your victory over Ariel, and Rhiza's abandonment of Marxon, the great majority of Commanders have disavowed themselves of the Avatar. Indeed, many in the government have publicly proclaimed their support for me. This is all thanks to you and your deeds on my behalf. However, we cannot stop now. To ensure the future, Marxon must be brought to justice for his crimes. Only then will the galaxy truly be saved."
CAMPDEB_0009="From: Evaluator Toth\nFlee, Rhianne! Marxon is staging a coup d'état! His followers have already murdered several of your supporters and I fear they will come for you next! I will try to lead them away, but I do not know how long I can distract them! Flee! Please! You must survive for all our sakes!"
CAMPDEB_0010="From: General Samantha Clarke\nTo: Princess Rhianne Burke\nCc: Champion {g PlayerName}\n I do not know if this will reach you, Princess, but I hope it does. I don't quite know what to say. It is strange, being at peace. My mind is still full of orders and strategies. I keep expecting field reports to arrive and bring news of fresh attacks. All I can say is that I wish I had known. I spoke with Dr. Brackman the other day. He is as stunned as I am. We are moving to formally recognize the Cybran Nation. It should not take long. I hope that I will get a chance to speak to you someday. I think I will enjoy peace."
CAMPDEB_0011="Princess Rhianne Burke\nPrivate Journal\nEarth is gone. We were so close, but in the end, my Champion could not stop Marxon. Just as he was about to fire Black Sun, UEF President Riley destroyed Earth rather than be defeated. Billions are dead. There can be no peace now. I am forced to name a new Avatar-of-War. Operations against the Cybrans will continue. I will be known as the Princess who defeated the UEF and purged the Cybrans from the galaxy. I will be revered not for peace, but for war. I wish Toth were here. I wish there was another way. I wish I had never become Princess."
CAMPDEB_0012="With the defeat of the Cybrans on Capella, UEF Disaster Response Teams were quick to land and begin cleanup operations. Almost 40% of the Symbiont population was reported missing and any remaining Symbionts received thorough psychological and AI examinations to ensure that no 'Trojan Horse' programs were left behind. Overall civilian casualties were light and property damage was minimal. Note: Dr. Eric Sweeney, a noted scientist and Quantum Theorist, was reported missing. Statements taken from his coworkers suggest the Cybrans may have kidnapped him. More data will be posted as it is made available."
CAMPDEB_0013="Though eventually driven off by Colonel Zachary Arnold, the Cybrans had almost free reign across Capella for at least 11 hours. During that time, nearly 95% of the Symbiont population was abducted, leaving local industry critically short of manpower. Additionally, numerous public buildings were raided and destroyed, including a research facility. Director Marcus Thompson, despite leading a heroic defense of his facility, was killed in a bombing run, as was the greater part of his staff. Listed among the missing is Dr. Eric Sweeney, a noted scientist and Quantum Theorist."
CAMPDEB_0014="Despite the advantage of a two hour head start, Aeon forces were unable to make any progress towards occupying Luthien. Colonel Zachary Arnold led the defense of Station Lima Foxtrot and the evacuation of Luthien Colony. Both the Colony and the Station suffered only light damage and civilian losses were minimal. The Aeon Commander, despite a formidable base, was defeated and the Aeon have made no further attempts to occupy the planet."
CAMPDEB_0015="Despite heroic efforts by UEF personnel, Luthien was lost to Aeon invaders. Communication logs indicate that Station Lima Foxtrot was destroyed, with all personnel either declared dead or captured by the Aeon. Constable Keiichi Nakamura led the defense of Luthien Colony for nearly 24 hours before it was overwhelmed. Constable Nakamura has been posthumously awarded the UEF Cross 1st Class for his valor and leadership. All contact with Luthien has been lost."
CAMPDEB_0016="Although Matar was the scene of a hotly contested battle, UEF forces were victorious in driving the Aeon invaders from the planet. Notable was the presence of the Princess' Champion, who was defeated after a tough battle in the Gulf region. Despite the UEF victory, there is much sorrow over the loss of Colonel Zachary Arnold, a 22-year veteran and one of the UEF's best field commanders. President Riley has ordered all flags at half-mast for one week and will personally speak at the Colonel's memorial service."
CAMPDEB_0017="Despite a 14-hour battle on multiple fronts, Matar was lost to the Aeon. Included among the dead was Colonel Zachary Arnold, a 22-year veteran and one of the UEF's best field commanders. President Riley has ordered all flags at half-mast for one week and will personally speak at the Colonel's memorial service. All contact with Matar has been lost and it is presumed that the Aeon are currently capturing or murdering the remaining civilian population."
CAMPDEB_0018="Desperate to find a solution to the Cybran Gate Virus, the UEF dispatched Captain {g PlayerName} to Minerva, the largest Cybran colony ever found. There Captain {g PlayerName}, despite continued Cybran attacks, found not only data on the Virus, but also rescued Dr. Eric Sweeney, who was kidnapped during the fight for Capella. Dr. Sweeney had further information: Dr. Brackman himself was on Minerva. Despite a valiant effort, Brackman managed to escape, but his facility and current research were destroyed. With the return of Captain {g PlayerName} and the successful completion of his mission, the UEF has the tools it needs to continue the fight against the enemies of Earth."
CAMPDEB_0019="Desperate to find a solution to the Cybran Gate Virus, the UEF dispatched Captain {g PlayerName} to Minerva, the largest Cybran colony ever found. Despite all precautions, Captain {g PlayerName} was unable to find the necessary research. UEF Quantum Specialists warn that the Cybran Virus is continuing to spread across the Gates and will completely infest the Quantum Gate Network within 20 solar days. Further operations on Minerva are unlikely."
CAMPDEB_0020="Despite attacks by both Aeon and Cybran forces, Captain {g PlayerName} safeguarded the research facilities on Pisces IV and delivered vital materials for Project: Black Sun to Earth. Withstanding both nuclear and conventional assault, the Commander stood firm against the invaders and ensured the future of the UEF."
CAMPDEB_0021="UEF Command announced a minor setback today, the loss of Pisces IV. Home to a small colony and R&D facilities, Pisces IV was attacked by both Aeon and Cybran forces. Captain {g PlayerName} was sent to contain the Aeon attack and was pushing back when he was blindsided by a covert Cybran force. Despite the uneven odds, Captain {g PlayerName} continued a valiant defense before being forced off the planet. UEF Command reassures its citizens that this is an isolated incident and that they expect to retake the planet soon."
CAMPDEB_0022="UEF Command has proclaimed victory in the Infinite War! The war is over! Despite a massive Aeon invasion and Cybran attacks, the UEF held firm and fired a secret weapon, Project: Black Sun, which destroyed both the Aeon homeworld of Seraphim II and several Cybran core worlds. The Aeon Princess and Dr. Gustaf Brackman both offered their immediate surrender. A new day has dawned across the galaxy! The UEF is victorious!"
CAMPDEB_0023="A glorious new light has come to the UEF. With the fall of UEF Command, the Aeon have taken up the reins of the galaxy. Avatar-of-War Marxon has assured the citizens of the UEF that their lives can only improve under Aeon leadership. Disease, poverty and social inequality are all unknowns in the Illuminate and we are certain to reap the benefits of their enlightened and advanced civilization. Long live the Illuminate!"
CAMPDEB_0024="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nIt appears that Dr. Brackman was correct in his assessment of your abilities. I admit to some doubt, but am pleased to have been proven wrong. All Symbionts from Theban 2 have been rescued and are being integrated into the Nation. Jericho, in particular, has been most eager to help and has volunteered for field duty. Perhaps you will see him again one day. Rest for now, Commander, you will be needed again soon."
CAMPDEB_0025="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Doctor Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\nI am afraid your protégé did not perform as expected. He failed in his primary objectives and as a result, very few Symbionts were rescued from Theban 2. I would not recommend this Commander for further duties at this time."
CAMPDEB_0026="From: Brackman\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nExcellent work, my boy, excellent work! We will certainly put this Tech to good use, oh yes. It pleases me to no end that we were able to snatch the Aeon's most beloved artifacts right out from under them. It is too bad about Mach, but this just shows how powerful this technology is. It's quite amazing, oh yes."
CAMPDEB_0027="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Dr. Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\n I am certain that you already know, Doctor, that your protégé failed on Orionis. It was, perhaps, foolish to send him, but we cannot look back. We are considering another attempt on Orionis, but with the Aeon alerted, it will require a full scale invasion, something we cannot afford. The techs are looking for alternative targets, but nothing has come up so far. I will let you know the moment we have news."
CAMPDEB_0028="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\nYou did well on Minerva, Commander. Dr. Brackman, all of us, are pleased with how you handled yourself. The mayor of York18 has even sent his personal thanks for your performance. As you no doubt know, the war is coming to a head. The Aeon are pressing the UEF and we cannot let them win. Now is the time for us to make our move and you will lead the charge. Enjoy yourself, Commander, you have earned it."
CAMPDEB_0029="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Dr. Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\n I am pleased to hear that you escaped Minerva. The UEF are still there, no doubt ransacking whatever they can find. I think we must forget about Minerva. Now that the UEF knows about it, they will monitor it for any sign of activity. They are nothing if not persistent. Your protégé failed in his mission. It was, in truth, a difficult fight, but I am not certain that he can be trusted for further frontline operations. He can, of course, continue as a Commander, but only if the missions are of secondary importance. Let me know your thoughts."
CAMPDEB_0030="From: QAI\nTo: Dr. Brackman; Elite Commander Dostya; Commander {g PlayerName}\nRe: Status\nMy systems have been thoroughly diagnosed and all damage has been repaired. I am continuing my work on the Quantum Virus. The Aeon interference had no impact and I am .23% ahead of schedule. The Aeon purpose is still uncertain. They were obviously searching for something, but I have no reference for their motivation. All operations are proceeding as planned."
CAMPDEB_0031="From: Tech ID 227, Node Technician, Procyon\nTo: Dr. Brackman; Elite Commander Dostya; Commander {g PlayerName}\nSir, we have completed our analysis of the damage and it's bad. Not only did the Aeon have complete access to QAI's data banks, they also managed to get into the central router and traced a number of messages. We can't be certain what they got, but it's a safe to assume that they at least know where a couple dozen Nodes are. We've already sent warnings, but I don't know if that's enough. They also destroyed QAI's mainframe. We managed to salvage quite a bit, but QAI lost almost 39% of its memory. It'll be at least a year before QAI will be operating at 100% again. Awaiting further instruction."
CAMPDEB_0032="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nGlad to see you made it, Commander. I apologize for the situation with Hex5. If I had my way, he and his entire Node would be breathing vacuum, but the Doctor is much more lenient than I. We received the access codes for Black Sun and are preparing for the mission to Earth. You will lead that assault. The hopes and dreams of the entire Nation rest in your hands."
CAMPDEB_0033="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Dr. Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\nWe have no options left, Doctor. We cannot hope to hack Black Sun's controls before the Aeon conquer Earth. I am recommending a full evacuation. The Nation must run if it is to survive. I have asked for volunteers to stay behind with me and slow the Aeon down. We should be able to buy you at least a few months. Hopefully, something, a new plan, some brilliant insight, will occur and you will be able to save our people. Do svidanya, Doctor, it has been a privilege knowing you."
CAMPDEB_0034="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nCongratulations, Commander! You have ended the Infinite War! You no doubt have your hands full, but if you check your aft storage compartment, you will find a very good bottle of vodka. I look forward to seeing you in a few years. Dostya."
CAMPDEB_0035="To: All Cybran Commanders\nFrom: Elite Commander Dostya\nCommander {g PlayerName} failed. He was unable to spread the Quantum Virus and shut down the Gate Network. The Aeon will quickly turn its sights on us. All civilians will be evacuated to the furthest reaches of our territory. I am asking for volunteers to stay behind with me and detonate the Gates once the civilians are gone. This, combined with our delaying action, should give them some time. Make no mistake, those who volunteer will not return. "

E01_B01_002_010="Intel reports that two Cybran Commanders gated to Capella over an hour ago. We presume they're attempting to inflame the Symbiont population."
E01_B01_002_020="Why is our time being wasted with this OP? The local forces there should be able to handle it."
E01_B01_003_005="Because of President Riley's insistence that we fight across multiple fronts, we had to pull troops away from Capella for other OPs. As a result, the Research Facilities on Capella are only lightly defended. The Cybrans must not be allowed to compromise our work."
E01_B01_003_010="Are we there to secure Capella for good? Or are we going to let it fall to the Cybrans in a month?"
E01_B01_003_020="You have your orders, Colonel. You gate at 11:30 hours. Dismissed."
E01_D01_010_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Lieutenant! Come in, Lieutenant!  We've lost your signal...Lieutenant, report..."
E01_M01_010_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Sir, Colonel Arnold is clearing out your landing zone. He will provide you with tactical advice during the course of the mission. EarthCom out."
E01_M01_030_010="[{i Leopard11}]: The more you oppress us, the stronger we become."
E01_M01_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: Listen up, rookie. I know what they taught you at the academy regarding Cybran tactics, but you need to forget all that crap. The Cybrans are no longer running from a stand-up fight, and they're not afraid to come at you with guns blazing. Your predecessor forgot that and paid the price."
E01_M01_040_020="[{i Arnold}]: Start by building some Power Generators and Mass Extractors."
E01_M01_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: Get movin' on those Power Generators, rookie."
E01_M01_055_010="[{i Arnold}]: Without any power, you're not gonna be able to fight back."
E01_M01_060_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Sir, maybe you should check your objectives."
E01_M01_065_010="[{i Arnold}]: It's time to get into the fight! Build some Mass Extractors!"

E01_M05_010_010="[{i Arnold}]: Nice work. Always build as quickly as possible; it'll save your backside if you gate into a hot LZ. Get some additional units online and destroy that air base to the southwest. There's some Cybran bombers prowling around, so take a few Mobile Anti-Air with you."
E01_M05_020_010="[{i Arnold}]: Not bad, rookie, but don't let it go to your head. Make one mistake, and the Cybrans will tear you apart."
E01_M05_020_020="[{i Arnold}]: Blast, there's another Cybran Commander. I'm gonna deal with him. The rest of this OP is yours. I'm leaving you with some reinforcements. They're a few steps above your pay grade, but that doesn't mean you can't play with 'em."
E01_M05_025_010="[{i Leopard11}]: That air base was meaningless. The larger struggle remains."
E01_M05_025_020="[{i Arnold}]: Ignore his psycho-babble."
E01_M05_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: You waitin' for that Cybran air base to fall apart on its own? "

E01_M06_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: What are you doing, takin' a nap? Get down there and take out that defensive line!"
E01_M06_055_010="[{i Arnold}]: I gave you an order to take out that defensive line, rookie. Jump to it!"
E01_M06_OBJ_010_611="Destroy all Towers Along the Defensive Line"
E01_M06_OBJ_010_612="You have received some advanced units from Colonel Arnold; use them to attack the Cybran defenses. All enemy Anti-Aircraft Turrets and Point Defenses must be destroyed."

E01_M07_020_010="[{i Thompson}]: Commander...can you read me? This is Assistant Research Director Thompson. The Cybrans are attacking us, and I don't know how much longer our defenses will hold. I'm patching you into our systems. You'll have access to our Long-Range Radar."
E01_M07_030_010="[{i Thompson}]: Commander, we have a Light Artillery Installation available, but we don't have enough power to fire it. The Cybran has some Tech 2 Power Generators to the far west. If you can capture one of them, we can tap into your grid and fire the weapon."
E01_M07_030_020="[{i Arnold}]: I like it. Go capture one of those Tech 2 Power Generators."
E01_M07_040_010="[{i Thompson}]: Commander, we have analyzed the Cybran's base. All of their Anti-Air Towers are positioned along their southern perimeter."
E01_M07_040_020="[{i Arnold}]: That's what we needed to hear. Round up some ground forces and destroy those Anti-Air Towers, rookie. Once they're down, bomb the Cybrans back to the stone age. You should also look at getting a second base off the ground. There's a lot of Mass where the Cybran defensive line was positioned. Check it out."
E01_M07_060_010="[{i Arnold}]: Did you forget why we're here? You need to recapture the R&D Facility to the south."
E01_M07_070_010="[{i Arnold}]: Looks like the Cybran brass ain't too happy with you. Don't worry, I'll take care of 'em. You just worry about that other Commander."
E01_M07_080_010="[{i Thompson}]: We appreciate the assistance, Commander, but...oh my god...the Cybrans took Dr. Sweeney. He's one of our top researchers and key to Black Sun--"
E01_M07_080_020="[{i Arnold}]: Shut up, Thompson! You eggheads get back to what you were doing. We'll worry about Sweeney."
E01_M07_090_010="[{i Leopard11}]: Recall, dammit! Recall!"
E01_M07_090_020="[{i Arnold}]: You actually took him down. Maybe you are cut out for this."
E01_M07_100_010="[{i Leopard11}]: The Cybrans will never admit defeat."
E01_M07_110_010="[{i Thompson}]: The southern facility has been lost. All the researchers, all the work...it's all gone... "
E01_M07_130_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Sir, General Clarke sends her congratulations for successfully completing your first mission."
E01_M07_150_010="[{i Arnold}]: The R&D Facility is still under Cybran control. Get some forces down there ASAP. "
E01_M07_155_010="[{i Arnold}]: We don't want the Cybrans poking around that R&D Facility. Recapture it as soon as possible. "
E01_M07_160_010="[{i Arnold}]: I'm not hearing any Cybran ACUs cooking off, rookie."

E02_B01_001_010="While you were busy on Capella, the Aeon pushed out of the Quarantine Zone and attacked our positions on Luthien. Our forces there are holding their own, but they will fall unless they're reinforced."
E02_B01_002_010="The strategic importance of Luthien cannot be overstated. The planet is rich in natural resources and home to a small Research and Development Facility that is doing work vital to the UEF; it must not fall to the Aeon."

E02_M01_030_010="[{i Arnold}]: Use your transport to move either your Armored Command Unit or an Engineer to Lima. Scans are showing a lot of Aeon activity between you and the facility, so it's going to be hot. Clear out the enemy before you try and reach Lima. "
E02_M01_030_020="[{i Arnold}]: You're on your own, rookie."
E02_M01_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: Wait, what the...those eggheads dropped me on the wrong side of the continent! I'm no help, EarthCom, it'll be hours before I can get there. Tell Clarke the rookie will have to do it on his own!"
E02_M01_040_020="[{i EarthCom}]: Lieutenant, General Clarke has placed you in charge of the OP. Establish a base with some basic defenses and then build an Air Factory. Colonel Arnold will advise as necessary."

E02_M01_080_010="[{i Stenson}]: ...the thermal shield is failing! The Core will explode any minute!"
E02_M01_080_020="[{i Arnold}]: What are you doing? Get over there and help them! We're going to lose that whole Facility!"
E02_M01_090_010="[{i Stenson}]: Thank goodness you've made it! Repair the Core, quickly!"
E02_M01_140_010="[{i Arnold}]: Looks like you got all the patrols. You actually impressed me with that one, rookie."
E02_M01_150_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Station Lima Foxtrot come in. I repeat, Station Lima Foxtrot come in. It's no good. I think we lost them. Abort mission and recall. EarthCom out."

E04_B01_002_010="I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain, but we have an emergency. Our techs have determined the Cybrans are behind the recent problems with our Gates."
E04_B01_003_010="Somehow, they managed to hack into the Quantum Gate Network and install a virus. It's spreading throughout the entire system, and the Cybrans could use it to shut down specific Gates. If that happens, they will have us cornered and isolated."
E04_B01_004_010="Intel has managed to decrypt a number of virus-related transmissions, and they are originating from Minerva. Although it's deep in Cybran-controlled space, we managed to scan the planet. It's home to the largest Cybran colony that we have ever seen.

E05_M03_160_010="[{i Riley}]: All the trucks reached Earth! Excellent job, Captain. The UEF is lucky to have soldiers like you in the field. Riley out."
E05_M03_170_010="[{i Sweeney}]: We can't replace those components! Earth is finished!"
E05_M03_180_010="[{i Clarke}]: A facility has been lost. Black Sun cannot be completed. Return to Earth, Captain. We'll fight them here."

E06_B01_001_020="The Aeon army is closing in on all fronts and Cybran sleeper cells here on Earth have become active, inciting riots across the entire planet. It's getting ugly. And it's gonna get worse."
E06_B01_002_010="Black Sun facility is located here, on the island of Ni'ihua in the Hawaiian chain. Your job is simple: You will protect Black Sun during the final stages of its completion. Once it is operational, you will fire it. Captain Aiko is currently in charge of security at the Facility; she will offer her unconditional assistance. You now have full access to the UEF arsenal."
E06_B01_003_010="Our fate rests in your hands, Major. Godspeed."

E06_M01_010_010="[{i Aiko}]: Sir, one of the transports ferrying parts for Black Sun has been shot down. It crashed on a small island to the east. You must recover the component it was carrying!  Pick it up with a transport and deliver it to Black Sun."

E06_M02_010_010="[{i Aiko}]: Black Sun is almost ready to fire. We just need to hold out a bit longer."
E06_M02_015_010="[{i EarthCom}]: We're showing that Black Sun is almost ready to fire. Continue to defend it! EarthCom out."
E06_M02_020_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Sir, we've detected enemy units to the south east. We think it could be the Aeon. Send out a Scout and if the Aeon are there, eliminate them. EarthCom out."

E06_M02_045_020="[{i EarthCom}]: We're showing incoming Cybran forces. EarthCom out."
E06_M02_050_010="[{i Aiko}]: Sir, some Siege Assault Bots and Mobile Missile Launchers have made it through. They're yours to command!"
E06_M02_060_010="[{i Aiko}]: Sir, a Cybran transport is carrying Engineers toward the Black Sun Control Center. They must be stopped!"
E06_M02_065_010="[{i EarthCom}]: A Cybran transport is attempting to land Engineers near the Black Sun Control Center. You are to stop them. EarthCom out."
E06_M02_070_010="[{i Clarke}]: The Control Center has been captured! We cannot fire Black Sun without it. Recapture it! Now!"
E06_M02_080_010="[{i Aiko}]: We've retaken the Control Center. Our techs are reloading the software to ensure that the Cybrans didn't corrupt the system."
E06_M02_085_010="[{i EarthCom}]: The Control Center is back under our control. Our techs are reloading the software to make sure that the Cybrans didn't damage the system."

E06_M02_100_020="[{i Riley}]: Fighting rages all across Earth. We are quickly losing ground, but if you can fire Black Sun, our losses will have been worth it. "

E06_M02_110_010="[{i Clarke}]: Attention UEF Forces, this is General Clarke. We have lost Black Sun, but we will never surrender! All units return to Earth Command. We will make our final stand there. Clarke out.\n\n"

E_Outro_FMV_Credits_010_020="Thirty years ago, I was a young Commander, excited at the prospect of joining the fight against the UEF's enemies. With each passing battle, however, the terrible death and destruction caused by the Infinite War seeped into my soul. I realized that this struggle had been going on for over 1,000 years. And I knew it had to end. Today, I stand before you with this news: The Infinite War is over! We are victorious!"
E_Outro_FMV_Credits_010_030="There is no question that this is both a great day for both the UEF and humanity. But as we take to the streets in celebration, I ask that each of you remember the valiant souls who gave their lives so that we might be here today. Keep the honor and humility of their actions close to your heart."
